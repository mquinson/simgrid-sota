simgrid-sota
============

Source code of experiments to compare the simgrid simulator to its
state of the art. It currently contains two sets of experiments, each
in their own subdirectory:

* GridSim: validity assessment of this famous simulator.
* SimMatrix: performance assessment

We did our best to ensure that these experiments are fair to the
tested tools, but nobody's perfect. You are more than welcome to check
this code, and propose improvements. In particular, if you are one of
the authors of one of these tools and think that our comparison is not
fair for some reason, please fork this repository, improve the
experiment testing your tool and issue us a pull request. We will
happily integrate it.
